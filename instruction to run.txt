Admin login instruction:
I have used Google Authenticator for login.
Thus, I cannot share my Gmail credentials as Gmail presently requires mobile no. for verification and its dangerous to share Gmail credentials.

Thus, for login as admin, kindly change line 16 in authRoutes.js to your email, and then you can log into that account as admin and can use admin functionalities.
